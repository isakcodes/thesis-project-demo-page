# `html-midi-player` website

This is the source code for https://cifkao.github.io/html-midi-player/. It is given here as an example of including `html-midi-player` in a website built using tools like the [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) bundler and the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator.

To use it, install all the dependencies:
- `bundle install` for the Ruby dependencies (you may need to install Bundler 2.3.12 first)
- `yarn install` for the Node.js dependencies (you may need to install Yarn first)

Then run `yarn dev` for live development or `yarn build` to build the website ready for deployment.
